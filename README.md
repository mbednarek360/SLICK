## **Description**

SLICK is a fast and light symmetric key cipher written in Rust. It allows for encryption of files of any size with a previously generated key. It has a 128bit max key complexity and can theoretically encrypt files up to 17.5 exabytes in size, although this is limited by available memory.

SLICK is program made for recreation and may not be perfectly optimized or bug free, although effort has been put into optimizing effeciency. I will try my best to fix bugs and improve features such as error handling, but I don't have infinite time. Feel free to make a pull request or open an issue, and I will try to get to it when available.
